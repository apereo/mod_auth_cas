### THIS README IS MAINTAINED FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY AND
### HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO WORK SINCE v1.0.8

This is a *very* rough and dirty description of how to build
mod_auth_cas for Apache on Windows.  If you are not familiar with
building DLLs in Visual Studio for Windows, I suggest you wait
until the method is improved, likely using MinGW

This build will use Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, available from
Microsoft at http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

This has only been tested with:
	apache_2.0.61-win32-x86-openssl-0.9.7m
	Win32 OpenSSL v0.9.8g
	Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit

NOTE:	As of mod_auth_cas 1.0.9, Win32 support has been dropped due
	to lack of development resources and low community interest.
	As a result, these instructions may be inaccurate.  As an
	explicit example, the additional curl and libpcre2 dependencies are
	not addressed in these instructions at all.

====================================================================

1) Install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
2) Install Apache
3) Install OpenSSL
4) Verify Apache works
5) Checkout mod_auth_cas from Subversion
6) Open VC++
7) File -> New -> Project from Existing Code
8) What type of project would you like to create?: "Visual C++"
9)
	Project file location: location of mod_auth_cas working copy
	Project name: mod_auth_cas
10) How do you want to build the project?:
	Use Visual Studio
	Project Type: Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) project
11) Accept all remaing default until wizard is complete
12) Project -> Properties
13) Click Configuration Properties
	Configuration Manager -> Active Solution Configuration -> "RELEASE"
14) Click Configuration Properties
	Configuration: Release
15) Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General

20) Build -> Rebuild Solution
21) Copy DLL from working_copy\Release\mod_auth_cas.dll to Apache modules directory, C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\modules
22) edit httpd.conf to include a block similar to the following:

	CASLoginURL https://login.example.com/cas/login
	CASValidateURL https://login.example.com/cas/serviceValidate
	CASCertificatePath c:/cacert.pem
	CASCookiePath c:/temp/
	<Location /secured >
		AuthType CAS
		Require valid-user
	</Location>
